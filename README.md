# Predictive Dynamic Control Accurately Maps the Design Space for 2,3-Butanediol Production

Creation of models, simulation of processes, and analysis of data as discussed in our research paper "Predictive Dynamic Control Accurately Maps the Design Space for 2,3-Butanediol Production" published in [CSBJ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2024.10.016).


## Folders
* ``models`` contains the metabolic model (including the stoichiometric matrix and upper and lower bounds) used in the simulations.
* ``simulations`` contains the dcFBA simulations and a postprocessing script.
* ``notebooks`` contains the analysis jupyter notebooks including all figures of the manuscript.
